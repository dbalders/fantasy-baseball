###MLB Fantasy Draft Team Tracker - [Demo](http://davidbalderston.com/mlbfantasy)

This site will allow you to choose who you drafted to show your teams strengths and weaknesses as you draft.

All of the data is from [Baseball Monster](http://baseballmonster.com) and stored as JSON in the `data.json` file.

All of the CSS and JS are inside the main `index.html` file, so all you need to do is open that file and your good to go

Your team is stored in LocalStorage so you can refresh and not lose everything, but there is no database holding the data

If you have something you want to add or a way to make this better, PR's and suggestions are definitely welcome :)
